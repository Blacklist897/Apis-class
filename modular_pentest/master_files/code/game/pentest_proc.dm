/**
 * Returns the atom(either itself or an internal module) that will interact/attack the target on behalf of us
 * For example an object can have different `tool_behaviours` (e.g borg omni tool) but will return an internal reference of that tool to attack for us
 * You can use it for general purpose polymorphism if you need a proxy atom to interact in a specific way
 * with a target on behalf on this atom
 *
 * Currently used only in the object melee attack chain but can be used anywhere else or even moved up to the atom level if required
